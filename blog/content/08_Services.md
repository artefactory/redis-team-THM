Summary: Day 10 - Services Endpoints
## Different Endpoints of the project

In the project, we have three main *services* with which the user can interact, these services are each one of the addresses of the API generated by the **FastAPI** python framework.

Concretely, when the *user* will make a request, the application will communicate with the backend and the databases to answer the request.

## Also a recap to how to use the different routes

Don't forget that you can call each API with your application to get the data from our databases 
| Endpoint | Method | Description | Request Body | Response Body |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| / | GET | Get a list of papers | `{"limit": int, "skip": int, "years":str, "categories":str}` | `{"total": total, "papers": papers}`
| /vectorsearch/text | POST | Get the data from paper id | `{"id"}` | `{"id": "123", "title": "THE TITLE", "abstract": "abstract", ...}` |
| /vectorsearch/text/user| POST | Get a list of paper for the given text by the user | `{"user_text": "string", "categories": ["physics.space-ph"], "years": ["1969"], "number_of_results": 5,"search_type": "KNN"}` | `{"papers": [{"id": "123", "title": "title", "abstract": "abstract"}, ...]}` |

## Example of Curl call :

    curl 'localhost/api/v1/paper/vectorsearch/text/user' \  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \             
    --data-raw '{"user_text":"people review","search_type":"KNN","number_of_results":15,"years":[],"categories":[]}'
